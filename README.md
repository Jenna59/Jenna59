I have experience working in banking, insurance, and B2B marketplaces. I'm currently seeking collaborations in the fintech sector and on SaaS projects. I enjoy crafting solutions to support small and medium-sized businesses and local enterprises.

Ask me about: 
- getting started in open source (the first time can be intimidating)
- frontend development
- UX
- rock climbing!
